This project provides the now deprecated `@TestMixin` unit testing framework for Grails 3.x which has been replaced by the new Trait-based https://github.com/grails/grails-testing-support[Grails Test Support project].

This project mainly exists for backwards compatibility and to ease upgrades for existing users.

To install the test mixin library add the following dependency to the
`dependencies` block of your `build.gradle` in a Grails application or plugin:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
testCompile "org.grails:grails-test-mixins:{version}"
